Option 1: Use apt-rdepends and apt download
1. Install apt-rdepends if not already present:
sudo apt-get install apt-rdepends

2. Download HAProxy and all its dependencies:
apt download $(apt-rdepends haproxy | grep -v "^ ")

This command lists all dependencies (recursively) and downloads each .deb file into your current directory, whether or not they are already installed.

Option 2: Force Re-download with apt-get
To force apt-get to re-download packages (including dependencies), you can combine cache cleaning and the --reinstall flag:

1. Clean the local apt cache to ensure all packages will be re-downloaded:
sudo apt-get clean
Run:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall --download-only haproxy
This will re-download HAProxy and any dependencies that are not currently installed, but it might not always fetch already installed dependencies unless they are explicitly specified or outdated

Option 3: Manual Dependency Listing and Download
If you want granular control, you can list dependencies and download each:
1. List dependencies:
apt-cache depends haproxy
2. For each dependency, run:
sudo apt-get download <dependency>


Example
sudo apt-get install apt-rdepends
apt download $(apt-rdepends haproxy | grep -v "^ ")
