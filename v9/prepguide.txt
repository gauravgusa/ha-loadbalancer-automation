HAProxy & Keepalived Cluster Installation Guide
1. Prerequisites
Linux hosts for load balancers and backend servers.

SSH access to all target hosts.

Python and Ansible installed on the control node.

The following directory structure (from your Ansible project):

text
ansible-lbhosts-airgap-ssl-complete/
├── inventory/
│   ├── group_vars/
│   │   └── all.yml
│   └── host.yml
├── playbooks/
│   ├── deploy-keepalived.yml
│   └── deploy-haproxy.yml
├── deployment.cfg
└── bootstrap.sh
2. Prepare Your Configuration
2.1. Edit deployment.cfg
Fill in your environment’s IPs and network details in deployment.cfg:

text
FLOATING_IP=10.168.10.101
PRIMARY_IP=10.168.10.102
SECONDARY_IP=10.168.10.103
HAPROXY_PORT=9999
INTERFACE=ens0012
WORKERNODE1_IP=10.168.10.104
WORKERNODE2_IP=10.168.10.105
WORKERNODE3_IP=10.168.10.106
2.2. Prepare Inventory Templates
Ensure that inventory/group_vars/all.yml and inventory/host.yml contain placeholders matching your deployment.cfg variables, such as:

{{ FLOATING_IP }}

{{ PRIMARY_IP }}

{{ SECONDARY_IP }}

{{ HAPROXY_PORT }}

{{ INTERFACE }}

{{ WORKERNODE1_IP }}, etc.

For hostnames, use {{ lbhost1 }} and {{ lbhost2 }} in host.yml.

3. Installation Steps
3.1. Make the Bootstrap Script Executable
bash
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
3.2. Run the Bootstrap Script
bash
./bootstrap.sh
This script will:

Load variables from deployment.cfg.

Replace placeholders in inventory/group_vars/all.yml and inventory/host.yml with actual values using sed.

Run Ansible playbooks to install and configure Keepalived and HAProxy:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/host.yml playbooks/deploy-keepalived.yml

ansible-playbook -i inventory/host.yml playbooks/deploy-haproxy.yml

Check and print the status of both haproxy and keepalived services.

3.3. Verify Service Status
The script will automatically run:

bash
systemctl status haproxy
systemctl status keepalived
Review the output to ensure both services are active (running).

4. Post-Installation
Access HAProxy on the floating IP and configured port (e.g., http://10.168.10.101:9999).

Check the HAProxy stats page (if enabled) at http://<FLOATING_IP>:<STATS_PORT>/stats.

5. Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors, check the Ansible output and system logs on the target hosts:

/var/log/haproxy.log

/var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog

Ensure all variables in deployment.cfg are set and match the placeholders in your YAML files.

Summary
This guide provides a robust, repeatable process to deploy a highly available HAProxy load balancer cluster with Keepalived using Ansible automation. The bootstrap.sh script automates configuration templating and deployment, ensuring consistency and minimizing manual intervention.
