To set up HAProxy and Keepalived in an air-gapped Debian-based system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 11) using .tar.gz and .deb files,
with the final deliverable being a single .tar.gz file containing all necessary packages and a bootstrap.sh script to install
and configure both tools, we’ll follow these steps. 
The process involves preparing all files on an internet-connected machine, 
creating a bootstrap.sh script to automate installation on the air-gapped servers, and packaging everything into a .tar.gz archive. 
The setup will configure a high-availability load balancer with a Virtual IP (VIP) using Keepalived.

Step 1: Prepare Files on an Internet-Connected Machine
On a machine with internet access (same OS as the air-gapped servers, e.g., Ubuntu 20.04), 
download all required .tar.gz source files, .deb packages, their dependencies, and create the bootstrap.sh script.

1.1 Create a Working Directory
mkdir -p ~/airgap_haproxy_keepalived
cd ~/airgap_haproxy_keepalived
mkdir deb_files source_files config_files

1.2 Download HAProxy
1.2.1 Source (.tar.gz):
Download HAProxy 2.8.3 (or the latest version from http://www.haproxy.org/):

#wget http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.8/src/haproxy-2.8.3.tar.gz -O source_files/haproxy-2.8.3.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/releases/tag/v.2.2.8/v2.2.8.tar.gz -O source_files/haproxy-2.8.3.tar.gz

1.2.2 Debian Package (.deb):
Add the HAProxy repository and download the .deb package with dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vbernat/haproxy-2.8 -y
sudo apt update
apt download haproxy=2.8.\*
mv haproxy_*.deb deb_files/

Notes : Replace focal with your OS codename (e.g., bullseye for Debian 11).

1.2.3 Dependencies for HAProxy:
Download all dependencies:

apt-cache depends haproxy | grep Depends | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt download
mv *.deb deb_files/

sudo apt install -y apt-rdepends
apt-rdepends haproxy libopentracing-c-wrapper0 libpcre3-dev | grep -v "^ " | sort -u | xargs apt download
mv *.deb ~/airgap_haproxy_keepalived/deb_files/

1.3 Download Keepalived
1.3.1 Source (.tar.gz):
Download Keepalived 2.2.8 (or the latest from http://www.keepalived.org/):
wget http://www.keepalived.org/software/keepalived-2.2.8.tar.gz -O source_files/keepalived-2.2.8.tar.gz

1.3.2 Debian Package (.deb):
Download Keepalived and its dependencies:
apt download keepalived
mv keepalived_*.deb deb_files/
apt-cache depends keepalived | grep Depends | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt download
mv *.deb deb_files/

1.4 Download Compilation Tools and Dependencies
For compiling HAProxy and Keepalived from .tar.gz, download build-essential and other required libraries:
apt download build-essential gcc make libc6-dev libssl-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev
mv *.deb deb_files/

1.4.1 Use apt-rdepends to capture recursive dependencies:

sudo apt install -y apt-rdepends
apt-rdepends build-essential gcc make libc6-dev libssl-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev | grep -v "^ " | sort -u | xargs apt download
mv *.deb deb_files/

1.5 Create Configuration Files
Create configuration files for HAProxy and Keepalived in config_files/. These will be copied to the air-gapped servers.

1.5.1 HAProxy Configuration (haproxy.cfg):
Create a basic load balancer configuration for two backend web servers:

nano config_files/haproxy.cfg
Add:

global
    log /dev/log local0
    maxconn 4096
    user haproxy
    group haproxy
    daemon

defaults
    log global
    mode http
    option httplog
    option dontlognull
    timeout connect 5000
    timeout client 50000
    timeout server 50000

frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    stats uri /haproxy?stats
    default_backend web_backend

backend web_backend
    balance roundrobin
    server server1 192.168.1.10:80 check
    server server2 192.168.1.11:80 check

1.5.2 Keepalived Configurations:
Create separate configurations for LB1 (Master) and LB2 (Backup).

1.5.2.1 For LB1 (keepalived_master.conf):
nano config_files/keepalived_master.conf
Add

global_defs {
    router_id HA_01
}

vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
    script "killall -0 haproxy"
    interval 1
    rise 3
    fall 3
    weight 2
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 110
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass test123
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
    track_script {
        chk_haproxy
    }
}

1.5.2.2 For LB2 (keepalived_backup.conf):
nano config_files/keepalived_backup.conf

global_defs {
    router_id HA_02
}

vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
    script "killall -0 haproxy"
    interval 1
    rise 3
    fall 3
    weight 2
}

vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface eth0
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100
    advert_int 1
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass test123
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.100
    }
    track_script {
        chk_haproxy
    }
}

1.6 Create bootstrap.sh
1.6.1 Create a bootstrap.sh script to automate installation and configuration on the air-gapped servers. The script will:

Install .deb dependencies.
Compile and install HAProxy and Keepalived from .tar.gz.
Set up configuration files and system settings.
Start services.

nano bootstrap.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any error
set -e

    make install
    cd ..
    mkdir -p /etc/haproxy /var/lib/haproxy
    touch /var/lib/haproxy/stats
    ln -sf /usr/local/sbin/haproxy /usr/sbin/haproxy
else
    echo "Error: HAProxy source file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 3: Install Keepalived from .tar.gz
echo "Installing Keepalived from source..."
if [ -f "source_files/$KEEPALIVED_SRC.tar.gz" ]; then
    tar xvfz source_files/$KEEPALIVED_SRC.tar.gz
    cd "$KEEPALIVED_SRC"
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    cd ..
    mkdir -p /etc/keepalived
else
    echo "Error: Keepalived source file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Copy HAProxy configuration
echo "Setting up HAProxy configuration..."
if [ -f "config_files/haproxy.cfg" ]; then
    cp config_files/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
else
    echo "Error: HAProxy configuration file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 5: Copy Keepalived configuration based on role
echo "Setting up Keepalived configuration..."
if [ "$SERVER_ROLE" = "master" ] && [ -f "config_files/keepalived_master.conf" ]; then
    cp config_files/keepalived_master.conf /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
elif [ "$SERVER_ROLE" = "backup" ] && [ -f "config_files/keepalived_backup.conf" ]; then
    cp config_files/keepalived_backup.conf /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
else
    echo "Error: Invalid role or Keepalived configuration file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 6: Configure system settings
echo "Configuring system settings..."
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p

# Step 7: Create HAProxy systemd service
echo "Creating HAProxy systemd service..."
cat > /etc/systemd/system/haproxy.service <<EOF
[Unit]

# Step 8: Create Keepalived systemd service
echo "Creating Keepalived systemd service..."
cat > /etc/systemd/system/keepalived.service <<EOF
[Unit]

# Step 9: Enable and start services
echo "Starting services..."
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable haproxy
systemctl start haproxy

# Step 10: Verify installation
echo "Verifying installations..."
haproxy -v
keepalived --version
echo "Setup complete! HAProxy and Keepalived are running."
echo "Access HAProxy stats at http://$VIP/haproxy?stats"

1.6.2 Make the script executable:
chmod +x bootstrap.sh

1.7 Package Everything into a .tar.gz
Create a single .tar.gz file containing all files:

cd ~/airgap_haproxy_keepalived
tar -czf airgap_haproxy_keepalived.tar.gz bootstrap.sh deb_files/ source_files/ config_files/

1.8 Transfer to USB Drive
sudo mkdir /media/$USER/usb_drive
sudo cp airgap_haproxy_keepalived.tar.gz /media/$USER/usb_drive/

Step 2: Install on Air-Gapped Servers
On both air-gapped servers (LB1 and LB2), perform the following steps.

2.1 Mount USB Drive
sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb
cd /mnt/usb

Replace /dev/sdX1 with the USB drive’s device name (check with lsblk).

2.2 Extract the .tar.gz
sudo mkdir /root/airgap_install
sudo cp airgap_haproxy_keepalived.tar.gz /root/airgap_install/
cd /root/airgap_install
tar xvfz airgap_haproxy_keepalived.tar.gz

2.3 Run bootstrap.sh
Run the script with the appropriate role (master for LB1, backup for LB2):
On LB1

cd /root/airgap_install
sudo ./bootstrap.sh master

On LB2:

cd /root/airgap_install
sudo ./bootstrap.sh backup

The script will:

Install all .deb dependencies.
Compile and install HAProxy and Keepalived from .tar.gz.
Copy configuration files to /etc/haproxy/ and /etc/keepalived/.
Configure system settings (IP forwarding, non-local binding).
Set up and start systemd services for HAProxy and Keepalived.
Verify the installations.

2.4 Unmount USB
cd ~
sudo umount /mnt/usb

Step 3: Test the Setup
Since the servers are air-gapped, testing requires local access or a connected client device.

2.4.1 Verify HAProxy: On LB1 or LB2, check the HAProxy stats page
curl http://localhost/haproxy?stats
Ensure backend servers (192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11) are listed and accessible.

2.4.2 Test Failover:
Stop HAProxy on LB1:
sudo systemctl stop haproxy

On LB2, verify the VIP is active:
ip a show eth0
The VIP (192.168.1.100) should appear.

Use a client to access http://192.168.1.100 to confirm traffic reaches backend servers.

3. Check Service Status:

sudo systemctl status haproxy
sudo systemctl status keepalived



Notes
Customization:
Update haproxy.cfg in config_files/ with your backend server IPs (replace 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11).
Update keepalived_master.conf and keepalived_backup.conf with your network interface (replace eth0) and VIP (replace 192.168.1.100).
If SSL is needed, include SSL certificates in config_files/ and modify haproxy.cfg (e.g., bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/cert.pem).
Dependencies: Ensure all .deb files in deb_files/ cover dependencies for build-essential, libssl-dev, libnl-3-dev, libnl-genl-3-dev, libpcre3-dev, and zlib1g-dev. If errors occur, recheck apt-rdepends output.
Firewall: If a firewall is active, allow ports 80, 443 (for SSL), and VRRP protocol (112) using iptables or ufw.
Error Handling: The bootstrap.sh script includes basic error checks. If .deb installations fail, run dpkg --configure -a manually. If compilation fails, verify all dependencies are installed.
Backup: Save /etc/haproxy/ and /etc/keepalived/ to the USB drive after setup for backups.
The final deliverable is airgap_haproxy_keepalived.tar.gz, which contains:

bootstrap.sh: The automation script.
deb_files/: All .deb packages for dependencies.
source_files/: HAProxy and Keepalived .tar.gz source files.
config_files/: Configuration files for HAProxy and Keepalived.
